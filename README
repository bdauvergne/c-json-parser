A simple JSON parser
====================

This parser is inpired by ry's http parser. As JSON can represent recursive
data structure, this parser could consume an unlimited amount of memory for its
state stack. The default depth supported is 1000.

TODO
----

- add a parameter for limiting string length
- correctly handle the unicode encoding as prescribed in
  http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt
- check UTF-8 encoding of characters in strings
- add a higher level parser built on the lower level one which report only fully
  parsed string and numbers.
